# üí´ About Code:
This code demonstrates the following steps of using ML for predictive maintenance for PLCs:<br><br>Data Loading: The historical PLC data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.<br><br>Data Preprocessing: No preprocessing is performed in this example.<br><br>Feature Engineering: The three main sensor readings (sensor1, sensor2, and sensor3) are used as features.<br><br>Model Training: A random forest classification model is trained using the training data.<br><br>Model Evaluation: The ROC AUC score is calculated to assess the model's ability to distinguish between failed and non-failed equipment.<br><br>This example uses a basic random forest model for illustration purposes. More sophisticated models, such as support vector machines or neural networks, may be more effective in certain situations. Additionally, more advanced preprocessing techniques, such as feature selection and data cleaning, can further improve the model's performance.<br><br>By integrating this machine learning model into the PLC software, operators can receive proactive alerts about potential equipment failures, allowing them to schedule maintenance before the equipment actually breaks down. This can prevent costly downtime, reduce maintenance costs, and improve overall plant productivity.
